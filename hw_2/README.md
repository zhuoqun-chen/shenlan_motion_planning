# shenlan_motion_planning

## Overview

This repo hosts my assignments of `shenlan motion plannsing` serial courses(2022Spring `Issue 9`).



Now the whole repo has two branches: `master` & `review`. The `review` branch is created for the review of teaching assistants. 

And my daily record of codes and resources are all put into `master` branch and this branch has the most complete content of all my thoughts. However, it is a little bit unfriendly to know the main focus of every chapter's homework. That's why I designed the structure of the repo with two branches.
